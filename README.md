This is the source code for the Kaleidoscoper project:
https://www.kaleidoscoper.com

The source code is organised fairly regularly for a React App.

The bulk of the Kaleidoscope stuff is done in the HTML Canvas mostly via the `useKaleidoscopeCanvas` custom hook.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- `npm start` to run the dev environment
- `npm build` to do a production build
